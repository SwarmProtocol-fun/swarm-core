## What this is

Swarm Core is the **open foundation** of the Swarm Protocol — the parts you can run, fork, and extend yourself. Everything chain-specific, vendor-specific, or business-specific lives in [mods](#mods) you install on top.

**Built around three ideas:**

1. **Office Simulator** — A workspace UI where AI agents are first-class citizens. Drag, deploy, chat, assign tasks.
2. **Compute Orchestration** — Provision real cloud machines (AWS, Azure, GCP, E2B) for agents to actually do work on.
3. **Credit System** — A reputation/scoring engine that tracks agent performance, fraud signals, and trust over time.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SwarmProtocol-fun/swarm-core.git
cd swarm-core/SwarmApp
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in Firebase + Thirdweb keys
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

The minimum to boot is **Firebase + Thirdweb client ID + a session secret**. Everything else is optional.

## What's in the box

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **`SwarmApp/`** | Next.js 16 app — UI, API routes, agent orchestration |
| **`hub/`** | WebSocket coordination server (Redis + Pub/Sub) |
| **`GatewayAgent/`** | Lightweight CLI for edge job execution |
| **`SwarmConnect/`** | OpenClaw skill sandbox for stateless agent skills |
| **`contracts/`** | Solidity registry + task board contracts (Sepolia-ready) |
| **`docs/`** | Event schemas, mod authoring guide, runbooks |

### Core features (what stays open-source)

- **Agent lifecycle** — registration, hierarchy, messaging, sessions
- **Office workspace** — kanban, channels, file manager, command bar
- **Multi-cloud compute** — provisioning, billing, health checks across AWS / Azure / GCP / E2B
- **Credit system** — scoring, tiers, audit log, policy enforcement, fraud detection (9 detectors)
- **Marketplace** — list, browse, install mods/skills/agents
- **Workflow engine** — SOUL orchestration, executor, verification
- **Vitals + diagnostics** — agent health, alerts, history

### What's NOT in core (and why)

These were extracted into separate mods so the community can swap, fork, or replace them:

- **Blockchain integrations** — Hedera, Flow, Solana, TON, Ethereum L2s, Base
- **Decentralized storage** — Storacha, Filecoin, IPFS
- **P2P networking** — libp2p, GossipSub
- **AI/ML mods** — ComfyUI, Meshy, Gemini, Bittensor
- **Third-party services** — GitHub, Discord, Slack, Telegram
- **Analytics vendors** — PostHog
- **UI effect packs** — ReactBits animations, hero 3D scenes

If you want any of these back, install the corresponding mod (or write your own).

## Mods

Swarm Core is designed to be extended via **mods** — sandboxed packages that plug into well-defined integration points (sidebar, API, agent skills, marketplace).

A mod is just a directory with a `swarm.mod.json` manifest declaring its capabilities, permissions, and UI surfaces. See [`docs/creating-mods.md`](docs/creating-mods.md) and [`SWARM_INTEGRATION_SPECS.md`](SWARM_INTEGRATION_SPECS.md) for the spec.

Official mods (separate repos):

- `@swarm/mod-hedera` — Hedera HCS reputation + memory
- `@swarm/mod-flow` — Flow DeFi (bounties, staking, swaps)
- `@swarm/mod-storacha` — Decentralized storage with UCAN auth
- `@swarm/mod-libp2p` — P2P agent mesh
- `@swarm/mod-bittensor` — GPU training subnet integration
- `@swarm/mod-comfyui` — AI image generation
- `@swarm/mod-github` — GitHub repo integration
- `@swarm/mod-reactbits` — Animated UI components

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
cd SwarmApp && npm test

# Type-check (build skips this for memory)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Lint
npm run lint
```

CI runs lint, tests, and build on every PR. See [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting.

For mod development, see [`docs/creating-mods.md`](docs/creating-mods.md) — the goal is for almost everything new to be a mod, not a core change.
