## 1. Overview

Swarm is an open-source project with structured ownership and guided development.
This document defines how decisions are made, who holds authority, and how
proceeds from the project are distributed.

## 2. Ownership Structure

## 3. DAO Hierarchy & Ranking System

The Swarm DAO operates under a tiered hierarchy designed to preserve proper
conduct, reward merit, and maintain operational integrity. The DAO reserves
the right to define, modify, and enforce this ranking system at its sole
discretion.

### 3.1 Hierarchy Tiers

```
Tier 0  ─  Sovereign          Project Lead / Founder
Tier 1  ─  Council            Nephilim VC + Senior Core Team
Tier 2  ─  Architects         Core Team members
Tier 3  ─  Guardians          Trusted long-term contributors
Tier 4  ─  Builders           Active contributors with merged work
Tier 5  ─  Initiates          New contributors (probationary)
```

Each tier carries specific privileges, responsibilities, and conduct
expectations. Movement between tiers is merit-based and subject to review.

### 3.2 Tier Definitions

#### Tier 0 — Sovereign (Project Lead)

The Sovereign has final authority on:
- Technical direction and roadmap
- Release schedules
- All tier promotions and demotions
- Day-to-day merge decisions
- DAO policy and conduct enforcement

**Current Sovereign:** EcosystemNetwork

The Sovereign may delegate authority but retains veto power on any decision
except IP Disposition (which requires the approval process defined in the LICENSE).

#### Tier 1 — Council

The Council consists of Nephilim Venture Capital representatives and Senior
Core Team members elevated by the Sovereign. The Council:
- Advises on strategic direction
- Holds approval rights over IP Disposition
- May propose governance amendments
- Oversees conduct review for Tier 2 and below

#### Tier 2 — Architects (Core Team)

Architects are recognized for sustained, significant contributions.
They have:
- Commit access to the main repository
- Voting rights on governance changes
- A share of the 33% Core Team allocation (divided equally among active
  Architects unless otherwise agreed)
- Authority to review and merge contributions
- Responsibility to mentor lower tiers

**Becoming an Architect:**
- Nominated by a Council member or the Sovereign
- Approved by the Sovereign
- Demonstrated track record of quality contributions over at least 6 months
- No active conduct violations

**Architects (initial):**
- EcosystemNetwork (Sovereign + Architect)

#### Tier 3 — Guardians

Guardians are trusted long-term contributors who have demonstrated consistent
quality and good conduct. They have:
- Priority review on their pull requests
- Eligibility for Core Team nomination
- Increased contribution weight (1.5x multiplier)
- May participate in conduct review panels

**Becoming a Guardian:**
- Minimum 3 months of active contribution
- At least 10 merged pull requests
- No conduct violations
- Nominated by an Architect, approved by the Sovereign

#### Tier 4 — Builders

Builders are active contributors with at least one merged contribution.
They have:
- Standard contribution weight for revenue share
- Ability to open issues, submit PRs, and participate in discussions
- Eligibility for Guardian promotion after sustained contribution

#### Tier 5 — Initiates

New contributors in a probationary period. They have:
- Ability to submit pull requests (subject to review)
- Reduced contribution weight (0.5x multiplier) during probation
- 30-day probationary period before promotion to Builder

Initiates are automatically promoted to Builder after their first merged
contribution and completion of the probation period with no conduct issues.

### 3.3 Conduct & Enforcement

The DAO hierarchy exists to preserve proper conduct. All participants,
regardless of tier, are bound by the following:

**Standards of Conduct:**
- Act in good faith and in the best interest of the project
- Respect the hierarchy and decision-making authority of higher tiers
- Do not misrepresent contributions, credentials, or tier status
- Do not attempt to manipulate contribution metrics
- Disclose conflicts of interest
- Follow responsible disclosure for security issues

**Enforcement Powers:**
- The Sovereign may demote, suspend, or remove any participant at any tier
- The Council may recommend demotions or removals to the Sovereign
- Architects may flag conduct violations for Council review
- Guardians may report concerns to Architects

**Consequences:**
- **Warning** — First minor violation; documented, no tier change
- **Probation** — Repeated minor or first major violation; tier frozen,
  increased review scrutiny for 90 days
- **Demotion** — Serious violation; dropped one or more tiers
- **Removal** — Egregious violation or pattern of misconduct; permanently
  removed from the DAO, forfeiture of unvested contribution weight

**Appeals:**
- Any participant may appeal an enforcement action to the Council
- Council review requires simple majority
- Sovereign's decision on appeal is final

### 3.4 Reserved Rights

The DAO expressly reserves the right to:
- Modify the ranking system, tier definitions, and promotion criteria
- Create new tiers or merge existing ones
- Adjust contribution weight multipliers
- Establish specialized roles within or across tiers
- Define additional conduct standards as the project evolves

These modifications follow the governance amendment process in Section 4.2.

status. Nephilim VC has:
