# OpenClaw Office Sim Studio — UX/UI PRD

> **Mod ID:** `openclaw-office-sim`
> **Type:** Premium Swarm Marketplace Mod
> **Version:** 0.1.0-draft
> **Date:** 2026-03-24
> **Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Vision

OpenClaw Office Sim Studio transforms the Swarm agent monitoring experience from static dashboards and log streams into a living, breathing virtual headquarters. Every agent becomes a visible employee — sitting at a desk, walking to a meeting, blocked at a whiteboard, or sprinting through a tool call. Two synchronized views serve distinct purposes: a **2D command-center map** for operational clarity, and a **3D immersive simulation** for cinematic explainability and agent storytelling.

Beyond observation, the mod introduces a **generative design studio** where users create custom office environments. ComfyUI powers visual concept generation — office themes, avatar portraits, scene styles, VFX concepts, and texture ideation. Meshy converts approved concepts into production-ready 3D assets — agent avatars, furniture, office decorations, themed rooms, props, and environmental set pieces. The result is an office that looks the way _you_ designed it.

The result is a mod that makes multi-agent systems *legible* to operators, *impressive* to investors, *intuitive* to developers, and *customizable* to creative users.

## 2. User Personas

### P1 — Solo Developer ("The Builder")
- Runs 3–10 agents locally or on a single VPS
- Wants to **see** what each agent is doing without reading logs
- Needs quick context switches: "which agent is stuck?" → click → inspect → unblock
- Cares about speed, keyboard shortcuts, and minimal chrome
- Likely discovers the mod from the Swarm marketplace, installs via one click

### P2 — Ops/Admin ("The Operator")
- Manages 10–50+ agents across an organization
- Needs filtering, search, batch operations, and alerting
- Uses the 2D view as a command center — multiple monitors, always-on
- Cares about uptime, error rates, cost attribution, and SLA compliance
- Wants replay capability for post-incident review

### P3 — Demo/Pitch Presenter ("The Storyteller")
- Showing the system to investors, customers, or executives
- Needs the 3D view to create a "wow" moment — agents visibly collaborating
- Wants a curated, cinematic experience: smooth camera, clean UI, no clutter
- May use replay mode to walk through a completed workflow step by step
- Needs one-click "demo mode" that hides sensitive data and shows representative activity

### P4 — Creative Designer ("The Worldbuilder")
- Wants the office to reflect a unique brand, theme, or aesthetic
- Uses Studio mode to generate concept art via ComfyUI and convert to 3D assets via Meshy
- Explores multiple style directions before committing (cyberpunk, cozy startup, space station)
- May be a designer on the team, or a solo dev with visual ambitions
- Values rapid iteration: prompt → generate → preview → approve → place
- Shares custom themes with the team or publishes them to the Swarm marketplace

## 5. 2D vs. 3D — Comparative Design Philosophy

The 2D and 3D views are not redundant. They serve fundamentally different cognitive purposes and are designed for different moments in the user's workflow.

### Design Intent

| Dimension | 2D Office | 3D Office |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Operational clarity | Cinematic explainability |
| **Metaphor** | Command center, control room | Headquarters walk-through |
| **Primary user** | Ops/Admin (P2), Solo Dev (P1) | Storyteller (P3), Worldbuilder (P4) |
| **Information density** | High — see 50 agents at once | Medium — see 10–20 comfortably |
| **Interaction model** | Click, filter, bulk select | Explore, follow, observe |
| **Always-on suitability** | Yes — low GPU, static layout | No — GPU-intensive, cinematic |
| **Key strength** | "Where is the problem?" | "What does our system _look like_?" |

### Feature Availability Matrix

| Feature | 2D | 3D |
|---|---|---|
| Agent status badges | Color ring + icon | Color ring + icon + animation |
| Agent positions | Fixed desk grid | Animated movement between zones |
| Speech bubbles | Tooltip on hover | Floating 3D billboard, always visible |
| Collaboration lines | Dashed SVG lines | Glowing arc particles |
| Tool call visualization | Gear icon pulse | Holographic icon + particle burst |
| Meeting rooms | Zone with agent icons inside | Glass room, agents sitting, gesturing |
| Error bay | Red-tinted zone | Red ambient lighting, slump animation |
| Portal spawn/despawn | Fade-in/out | Swirling vortex effect |
| Approval gate | Barrier graphic + button | Semi-transparent energy wall |
| Queue/inbox | Stacked card icons | Floating holographic task queue |
| Camera | Pan + zoom | Orbit, follow, cinematic, first-person, top-down |
| Filtering | Toolbar controls | HUD overlay controls |
| Custom assets (Studio) | N/A — 2D uses theme colors only | Full 3D asset placement from Meshy |
| Performance floor | 60 FPS at 50 agents | 30 FPS at 20 agents |

### Synchronized State

Both views share the same state store (Zustand). Switching between 2D and 3D preserves:
- Selected agent (drawer stays open)
- Active filters
- Replay scrubber position
- Zoom level maps to equivalent framing

The `[2D ↔ 3D]` toggle button is present in the toolbar of both views. Transition is a 300ms crossfade.

## 6. Studio Mode UX

Studio mode is the generative design workspace. It bridges two external tools — **ComfyUI** (image generation) and **Meshy** (3D model generation) — into a unified creative pipeline within the Swarm UI.

### 6.2 Concept Generator (ComfyUI Integration)

**Purpose:** Generate visual concepts that define the office aesthetic before committing to 3D assets.

**ComfyUI Workflow Types:**

| Workflow | Output | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `office-theme` | 4 concept images (exterior, interior, detail, mood) | Overall office aesthetic exploration |
| `avatar-portrait` | 1 portrait per agent, consistent style | Agent character design |
| `scene-style` | 2 environment images (day/night or warm/cool) | Lighting and atmosphere definition |
| `vfx-concept` | 4 effect reference images (particles, glows, portals) | Visual effects direction |
| `texture-sheet` | 4 tileable texture samples (wall, floor, desk, accent) | Material ideation |

- `GET /openapi/v2/text-to-3d/{taskId}` — poll job status
- Webhook callback when generation completes
- API key configured in mod settings (user provides their own Meshy key)
- Rate limiting: queue UI shows position, estimated wait time
- Output format: GLB (compatible with React Three Fiber / Three.js `useGLTF`)

**Interaction Model:**
- Select category → choose reference image (optional) → type prompt → generate
- Job enters queue with progress indicator
- On completion: 3D preview auto-loads with orbit camera
- User can rotate, zoom, inspect polygon count and texture quality
- Actions: **Approve** (adds to Asset Library), **Revise** (re-prompt with adjustments), **Dismiss** (delete)
- Approved assets flow to the Asset Library for placement

```

**Slot System:**
- The office has predefined **slots**: desk positions, wall mounts, ceiling fixtures, floor zones, prop spots
- Slots appear as dashed outlines when in edit mode
- Dragging an asset onto a slot snaps it into position with correct orientation
- Users can also free-place props outside slots with manual transform controls
- Each slot type accepts only compatible asset categories (desk slot accepts desks, not chairs)

**Interaction Model:**
- Drag from library sidebar → drop onto slot or free position
- Click placed asset → selection gizmo appears (translate, rotate, scale)
- Undo/Redo stack (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) for all placement operations
- "Save" persists the theme to user storage (Firestore)
- "Publish" opens a dialog to submit the theme to the Swarm marketplace

```

**Spatial Zones:**

| Zone | Purpose | Visual Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Desk Row** | Primary workspace. One desk per agent | Isometric desks with avatar, name label, status ring |
| **Meeting Room** | Agents in collaborative tasks/handoffs | Glass-walled room, agents inside show speech bubbles |
| **Queue/Inbox** | Unassigned or pending tasks | Stack of task cards, glow when overflowing |
| **Error Bay** | Agents in error/blocked state move here | Red-tinted zone, pulsing border, alert icon |
| **Tool Station** | Visualizes active tool calls (API, file I/O) | Animated gear/wrench icons, throughput counter |
| **Approval Gate** | Agents waiting for human approval | Barrier graphic, "Approve" button inline |

**Interaction Model:**
- **Hover** any agent → tooltip: name, current task, duration, status
- **Click** agent → opens Agent Detail Drawer (right panel)
- **Right-click** agent → context menu: inspect, reassign, pause, restart
- **Drag** agent to meeting room → initiate collaborative task
- **Click** empty desk → assign agent from dropdown
- **Scroll wheel** → zoom in/out on floor plan
- **Ctrl+F** → search agents by name, task, or status
- **Arrow keys** → pan the floor plan
- **Shift+click** → multi-select agents for bulk actions

**Toolbar Controls:**
- **Filter**: status (all/active/idle/error/blocked), agent type, department
- **Search**: fuzzy match on agent name, task description, skill name
- **Zoom**: fit-all, zoom-to-selection, percentage slider
- **Layers**: toggle labels, collaboration lines, task queues, alerts
- **Fullscreen**: expand to fill viewport (for always-on monitors)

**3D-Specific Features (Beyond 2D):**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Agent Animation** | Walk cycles between zones, typing at desk, gesturing in meetings, slumping when idle |
| **Speech Bubbles** | Floating 3D billboards above agents showing streaming text/tool invocations |
| **Collaboration Lines** | Glowing arcs between agents when they exchange messages |
| **Tool Call Effects** | Particle bursts for API calls, file I/O sparkles, database query ripples |
| **Environment Mood** | Ambient lighting shifts: warm (all healthy), cool blue (high load), red tint (errors) |
| **Portal Effects** | Swirling portal when agent spawns/despawns (inspired by openclaw-office) |
| **Skill Holograms** | Holographic icons above agent desks showing their active skills |
| **Custom Assets** | User-generated 3D models from Meshy placed via Studio asset placement |

**Camera Modes:**
- **Orbit** — default. Mouse drag rotates, scroll zooms, middle-click pans
- **Follow** — camera tracks a selected agent. Smooth lerp. Click another agent to switch
- **Cinematic** — auto-pilot camera that slowly orbits, zooms to action, pulls back for overview
- **Top-Down** — overhead orthographic view (bridge between 2D and 3D)
- **First-Person** — WASD walkthrough. Approach any desk to inspect

**HUD Overlay:**
- Semi-transparent name tags floating above each agent
- Status badges (color-coded dots matching 2D semantics)
- Mini-map in corner showing 2D floor plan with camera frustum indicator
- Click-through: clicking any agent in 3D opens the same Agent Detail Drawer

## 8. Interaction Design

### 8.1 Core Interaction Patterns

| Interaction | Context | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Hover** | Any agent (2D or 3D) | Show tooltip: name, task summary, duration, status badge |
| **Click** | Agent | Open Agent Detail Drawer. In 3D, camera also smoothly zooms to agent |
| **Double-click** | Agent | Follow mode (3D) or center-and-zoom (2D) |
| **Right-click** | Agent | Context menu: Inspect, Reassign, Pause, Restart, Copy ID |
| **Shift+click** | Multiple agents | Multi-select for bulk operations |
| **Ctrl+F / Cmd+F** | Anywhere | Global search — agents, tasks, events |
| **Scroll** | Floor plan / 3D scene | Zoom |
| **Drag** | Floor plan background | Pan (2D); Rotate (3D orbit mode) |
| **Spacebar** | Replay view | Toggle play/pause |
| **[ and ]** | Replay view | Decrease / increase playback speed |
| **Esc** | Drawer, modal, search | Close/dismiss |
| **?** | Anywhere | Show keyboard shortcut overlay |
| **Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z** | Studio placement mode | Undo last placement action |

### 8.2 Studio-Specific Interactions

| Interaction | Context | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Enter** | Concept prompt field | Submit prompt to ComfyUI |
| **Click image** | Concept board | Select/deselect for approval |
| **Drag asset** | Asset Library → 3D scene | Place asset into slot or free position |
| **Click placed asset** | Placement mode | Show transform gizmo (translate, rotate, scale) |
| **Delete / Backspace** | Selected placed asset | Remove from scene (with confirmation) |
| **G / R / S** | Selected placed asset | Switch gizmo: Grab, Rotate, Scale (Blender convention) |
| **Right-click asset** | Asset Library | Context menu: Preview, Edit, Delete, Download |

### 8.3 Real-Time Visual Feedback

When an event occurs on the WebSocket, the UI reacts within one frame:

| Event | 2D Reaction | 3D Reaction |
|---|---|---|
| Agent starts task | Status ring → green, desk lamp turns on | Agent sits down, starts typing animation |
| Agent completes task | Brief green flash, checkmark overlay | Confetti particle burst, agent stands and stretches |
| Agent error | Red pulse ring, moves to error bay | Red tint on agent, slump animation, warning particle |
| Agent enters meeting | Walks to meeting room zone | Walking animation to room, sits in chair |
| Tool call fired | Gear icon animates on desk | Holographic tool icon appears, sparkle particles |
| Agent blocked | Amber barrier graphic appears | Semi-transparent wall materializes in front of agent |
| Agent goes offline | Desk grays out, avatar fades | Agent fades to ghost, desk light turns off |
| New agent spawns | Fade-in at empty desk | Portal swirl effect, agent materializes |
| Agent waiting approval | Purple hourglass overlay | Agent raises hand, purple aura pulses |
| Collaboration initiated | Dashed line between agents | Glowing arc with data-stream particles |

### 8.4 Interaction Objects Glossary

| Object | Where | Interaction |
|---|---|---|
| **Desk** | 2D/3D | Click → inspect agent. Drag → reassign (admin). Empty desk shows "Assign" dropdown |
| **Room** | 2D/3D | Click → list agents inside. Rooms have capacity limits and types (meeting, war room, focus) |
| **Queue** | 2D/3D | Click → expand task list. Tasks can be dragged to agent desks |
| **Alert** | 2D/3D | Click → opens Agent Detail Drawer for the affected agent. Bell icon pulses |
| **Hologram** | 3D only | Floating skill/tool icon above desk. Click → tool call detail in drawer |
| **Tool-Call Effect** | 3D only | Particle burst for API calls. Hover → tooltip: "POST /api/v2/auth, 200ms" |
| **Portal** | 3D only | Swirl effect on spawn/despawn. Hover → "Agent-07 spawning, ETA 3s" |
| **Meeting** | 2D/3D | Visual grouping of agents in collaboration. Click room → see conversation thread |
| **Collaboration Arc** | 3D only | Glowing line between agents. Hover → "Agent-01 → Agent-04: code review handoff" |
| **Timeline Scrubber** | Replay | Drag → scrub through time. Click event marker → jump to moment |
| **Asset Slot** | Studio placement | Dashed outline in edit mode. Drag asset to fill. Glow when compatible asset hovers |

---

## 9. Visual Semantics — Agent States

A unified state vocabulary used across 2D, 3D, dashboard, and drawer:

| State | Color | 2D Icon | 3D Animation | Ring/Badge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Idle** | Gray `#6b7280` | Static avatar, dim desk | Standing by desk, arms at sides | Thin gray ring |
| **Active** | Green `#22c55e` | Bright avatar, lamp on | Typing at keyboard | Solid green ring |
| **Coding** | Emerald `#10b981` | Code brackets overlay | Fast typing, code hologram | Green ring + `</>` badge |
| **Blocked** | Amber `#f59e0b` | Barrier icon, pulsing | Arms crossed, barrier wall | Pulsing amber ring |
| **Error** | Red `#ef4444` | Error triangle, red desk | Slumped, red particles | Thick red ring |
| **Waiting Approval** | Purple `#a855f7` | Hourglass + hand icon | Looking at camera, hand raised | Purple ring + clock |
| **In Meeting** | Blue `#3b82f6` | In meeting room zone | Sitting in meeting room, gesturing | Blue ring |
| **Offline** | Dark gray `#374151` | Ghosted/faded avatar | Transparent ghost, desk dark | Dashed gray ring |
| **Spawning** | Cyan `#06b6d4` | Fade-in animation | Portal swirl effect | Expanding cyan ring |
| **Tool Calling** | Gold `#eab308` | Gear icon on desk | Holographic tool icon | Gold ring + tool icon |

Every state uses **triple encoding**: color + icon + label. Color is never the sole differentiator.

## 10. Visual Language & Design System

### 10.1 Design Principles

1. **Dark-first**: Dark mode is the default and primary experience. Light mode is supported but secondary
2. **Premium cinematic feel**: Glass morphism, subtle gradients, smooth 60fps animations. No janky transitions
3. **Information density without clutter**: Show everything that matters, hide everything that doesn't. Progressive disclosure
4. **AI company headquarters vibe**: The office should feel like a premium tech HQ — sleek, organized, impressive. Not a toy or a game
5. **Consistent with Swarm**: Inherits Swarm's amber primary (`#fbbf24`), dark blue backgrounds (`hsl(222, 84%, 5%)`), and shadcn/ui component patterns
6. **Modular panels**: Every section of the UI is a resizable, collapsible panel. Users control information density
7. **Multiplayer feel**: The office should feel like a shared space — activity feed, presence indicators, and real-time updates reinforce this

### 10.2 Color Palette

```
Primary:       hsl(48, 100%, 50%)   — Amber/Gold (Swarm accent)
Background:    hsl(222, 84%, 5%)    — Deep navy
Card:          hsl(222, 50%, 10%)   — Dark blue card
Border:        hsl(217, 33%, 18%)   — Subtle edge
Text Primary:  hsl(210, 40%, 98%)   — Off-white
Text Muted:    hsl(215, 20%, 65%)   — Gray text
Success:       hsl(142, 71%, 45%)   — Green
Warning:       hsl(38, 92%, 50%)    — Amber
Error:         hsl(0, 84%, 60%)     — Red
Info:          hsl(217, 91%, 60%)   — Blue
Premium:       hsl(270, 50%, 60%)   — Purple (Studio accent)
Studio:        hsl(280, 65%, 55%)   — Violet (Studio mode indicator)
```

### 10.3 Typography

- **Font**: Inter (matches Swarm app)
- **Headers**: `font-bold`, `text-lg` to `text-2xl`
- **Body**: `text-sm` (14px)
- **Labels/badges**: `text-xs` (12px) or `text-[10px]`
- **Monospace** (logs, IDs, prompts): `font-mono text-xs`

### 10.4 Component Patterns

- **Cards**: Glass-morphism with `backdrop-blur-xl`, `bg-card/80`, `border-border`, hover glow
- **Badges**: Colored backgrounds at 10% opacity, matching text color, `text-[10px]` with icon
- **Buttons**: Primary amber (`bg-amber-500 text-black`), secondary outline (`border-amber-500/30`), Studio actions use purple variant
- **Drawer**: `w-[400px]` slide from right, backdrop blur, `z-50`
- **Tabs**: Bottom-border style matching Swarm marketplace tabs
- **Modular Panels**: Every section of the office view is a resizable panel. Users can collapse/expand side panels, bottom trays, and the toolbar
- **Generation Progress**: Indeterminate shimmer bar for ComfyUI, percentage bar for Meshy (API provides progress)
- **Concept Board**: 2x2 image grid with rounded corners, hover-to-enlarge, action buttons on overlay
- **3D Preview Card**: Inline R3F canvas with orbit controls, dark background, subtle floor plane

### 10.5 Motion & Animation

- All transitions: `200ms ease-out` (CSS) or `lerp(0.08)` (3D camera)
- Agent movement: smooth interpolation between positions, never teleport
- Status changes: 300ms color transition with brief scale pulse (1.0 → 1.05 → 1.0)
- Drawer: slide in 250ms with spring easing
- 3D particles: GPU-instanced, max 500 particles per effect, auto-recycle pool
- Concept board image loading: skeleton shimmer → fade-in on load
- Asset placement: snap-to-slot with 100ms magnetic pull animation

---

## 11. Accessibility

### 11.1 WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Color contrast** | All text meets 4.5:1 ratio. Status colors paired with icons, never color-alone |
| **Keyboard navigation** | Full keyboard support: Tab through agents, Enter to inspect, Esc to close |
| **Screen reader** | `aria-label` on all agent nodes, `aria-live="polite"` on activity feeds |
| **Reduced motion** | `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all animations, 3D falls back to static positions |
| **Focus indicators** | Visible focus ring (amber) on all interactive elements |
| **Alt text** | Agent avatars include descriptive alt: "Agent Cipher, status: error, task: audit middleware" |

### 11.2 Cognitive Accessibility

- Agent states use **icon + color + label** (triple encoding) — never color alone
- Tooltips explain every icon and abbreviation
- Demo mode strips away advanced controls for simplified presentation
- Admin can configure "simplified view" that shows only desk + status, hiding effects
- Studio mode uses plain-language labels: "Generate Concepts" not "Run ComfyUI Pipeline"

### 11.3 Studio Accessibility

- Concept board images have alt text derived from the generation prompt
- 3D asset preview includes text description: "Desk, 12,412 polygons, cyberpunk style"
- Placement mode supports keyboard: arrow keys for position, `[`/`]` for rotation, `+`/`-` for scale
- All generation status updates announced via `aria-live` regions
- Color-blind safe: approved/dismissed assets use checkmark/X icons, not just green/red

### 11.4 Device Fallbacks

- On mobile or devices with `prefers-reduced-motion`, default to 2D view
- 3D view requires WebGL2 support — graceful fallback message with link to 2D
- Low-end device detection: if `navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4`, suggest 2D
- Studio 3D preview uses a lower-complexity renderer than the full office scene
- Concept generation and asset generation work regardless of GPU capability (server-side)

## 12. Performance Constraints

### 12.1 Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| **2D render** | 60 FPS with 50 agents | Chrome DevTools Performance panel |
| **3D render** | 30 FPS with 20 agents, 60 FPS with 10 | R3F performance monitor |
| **First paint** | < 1.5s (2D), < 3s (3D) | Lighthouse |
| **WebSocket latency** | < 100ms state update reflection | Timestamp diff |
| **Memory** | < 200MB (2D), < 500MB (3D) | Chrome Task Manager |
| **Bundle size** | < 150KB initial (2D), 3D lazy-loaded | Webpack analyzer |
| **Time to interactive** | < 2s (2D), < 4s (3D) | Lighthouse TTI |
| **ComfyUI concept generation** | < 30s for 4 images | Client-side timer |
| **Meshy 3D generation** | < 120s per asset | API progress polling |
| **Studio 3D preview** | 60 FPS single asset | R3F performance monitor |
| **Custom asset load** | < 2s per GLB file | Network + parse time |

### 12.2 Optimization Strategies

- **3D lazy-loading**: The entire React Three Fiber scene is code-split. Only loaded when user navigates to 3D view
- **Agent LOD (Level of Detail)**: Agents far from camera render as simple sprites. Full model only when close
- **Frustum culling**: Agents outside camera view are not rendered
- **Instanced meshes**: Desk geometry is instanced — one draw call for all desks
- **WebSocket batching**: Updates batched into 16ms frames, not per-event
- **Virtualized lists**: Activity feeds and event logs use virtual scrolling (only render visible rows)
- **SVG optimization**: 2D floor plan uses CSS transforms, not SVG re-renders, for animation
- **Replay**: Events stored as deltas, reconstructed on scrub. Not full snapshots per frame
- **Custom asset caching**: Generated GLB files cached in IndexedDB after first load
- **Texture compression**: Custom assets auto-compressed to KTX2 on import for GPU efficiency
- **Concept image caching**: ComfyUI outputs cached locally with prompt hash as key

### 12.3 Degradation Tiers

| Tier | Trigger | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Full** | Desktop, WebGL2, >4 cores | All features, 3D enabled, particles, post-processing, Studio 3D preview |
| **Reduced** | Laptop, integrated GPU | 3D available but no post-processing, reduced particles, simpler Studio preview |
| **Minimal** | Mobile, no WebGL, `prefers-reduced-motion` | 2D only, no animation, static positions, Studio concept-only (no 3D preview) |
| **Server-rendered** | SSR/bot crawl | Static HTML summary dashboard, no interactive office, no Studio |

### 12.4 Studio-Specific Performance

- ComfyUI and Meshy calls are server-side proxied — no direct client-to-external API calls
- Generation jobs are queued and polled, not blocking the UI thread
- 3D asset preview canvas is separate from the main office canvas — isolated WebGL context
- Maximum 50 custom assets per theme (to prevent scene overload)
- Assets exceeding 100k polygons trigger a warning with "simplify" option
- Concept board images stored as WebP, max 1024x1024, lazy-loaded thumbnails
