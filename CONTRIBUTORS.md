## Contribution Weight Calculation

Contribution weight determines each contributor's share of the 33% Community
allocation. It is calculated as:

```
weight = (merged_prs * 3) + (issues_triaged * 1) + (reviews * 2) + (docs_pages * 1)
effective_weight = weight * tier_multiplier
share = effective_weight / sum(all_effective_weights)
```

Weights are recalculated quarterly and published here. Disputes may be raised
to the Architects (Tier 2) for review.

**Last recalculation:** _Not yet performed_
**Next recalculation:** _Q3 2026_
